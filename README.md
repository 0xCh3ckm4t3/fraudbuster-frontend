# FraudBuster Frontend

This is the frontend repository for FraudBuster, a platform designed to detect and prevent fraudulent activities. The project currently supports fraud reporting for Nepal, with plans to expand functionality and add advanced features.

---

## Project Overview

FraudBuster is designed to provide users with an intuitive interface for reporting and analyzing fraudulent activities. Built using React and styled with TailwindCSS, the platform integrates with a backend API to handle fraud-related data and logic.

---

## Vision for the Final Website

The final version of FraudBuster will include:
- A comprehensive fraud detection and reporting system.
- Support for multiple countries with localized configurations.
- Tools for advanced data analysis and fraud visualization.
- Responsive design across all device types.
- Multi-language support for a global audience.

---

## Current Status

### Supported Features:
- Basic fraud detection and reporting interface.
- Support for one country: Nepal.

### In Progress:
- Adding different country wallets for fraud reporting.
- Displaying the total number of reports found for user queries.
- Basic security configurations:
  - Implementing secure headers using libraries like `helmet` (for the backend).
  - Configuring CORS policies to restrict API access to trusted origins.
  - Validating and sanitizing user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
  - Securing sensitive information such as API keys and tokens in environment variables.

### Planned Features:
- Multi-country support with region-specific fraud configurations.
- Enhanced localization with multi-language support for broader accessibility.
- Advanced fraud data analytics and visualization tools to provide insights and trends.

## Security Best Practices

For developers working on FraudBuster, follow these practices to maintain a secure frontend environment:
1. Environment Variables: Store sensitive data like API keys in `.env` files and never commit them to the repository.
2. Input Validation: Always validate and sanitize user inputs before sending them to the backend.
3. Dependencies: Regularly audit dependencies with tools like `npm audit` to identify and address vulnerabilities.
4. CORS: Configure backend APIs to allow requests only from trusted domains.
5. Secure Authentication: Use HTTPS for all API calls and handle tokens securely.
6. Content Security Policy (CSP): Add a CSP header to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks.
